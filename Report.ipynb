    "Human tastes in music are remarkably diverse, therefore music recommender is a best tool to help people find what they like. Moreover, more precisely music recommender recommend means more money music company can earn. So that it is a huge attraction for music company to improve their music recommender. However, the usual method collaborative filtering (CF) techniques suffer from a cold-start problem in many of the less popular items.\n",
    "Therefore, in order to increase the quality of recommender, we decide to implement a rich model for both the item and user biases, which accounts for the item taxonomy, user rating sessions. Besides, we expand basic personalization model to encompass more patterns observed in the data.\n"

    "There are several approaches to music recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods utilize user feedback (explicit or implicit) to infer relations in users and items, and ultimately relate users to items they like. This approach do not use domain knowledge.\n",
    "Context Based Filtering methods characterize items based on textual attributes, cultural information, social tags and other kinds of web-based annotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Given the nature of our dataset, we focus on a CF approach. However, algorithms based on basic collaborative filtering typically suffer from the cold-start problem when encountering items with little rating information. In our system [1], we use a taxonomy to share information between rated item, thus the representation of tracks with a little rating data naturally collapses to the representation of their respective album and artist which can lead to a better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would first employ a Matrix Factorization (MF) model which can be found at [2]. Typically, a predicted rating by user u to item i given by **rui=Î¼+bi+bu+puTqi** where **puTqi** captures the affinity of user u to item i. Then, according to the base paper [1], we would enhance our bias model by letting item biases share components for items linked by the taxonomy and adding Items temporal dynamics to expand item bias component. Also, for personalization model, we introduce shared factor components to reflect the affinity of items linked by the taxonomy.\n",

    "The dataset offers a wealth of information and services related to many aspects of music. We have compiled a dataset of user ratings of music items collected during a decade of using the Yahoo! Music website. The dataset was released within the first track of the KDD Cup 2011 contest. It comprises of 262,810,175 ratings of 624,961 items by 1,000,990 users. The ratings include both date and one-minute resolution timestamps, allowing refined temporal analysis. Each item and each user has at least 20 ratings in the whole dataset. The available ratings were split into train, validation and test sets such that the last 6 ratings of each user were placed in the test set and the preceding 4 ratings were used in the validation set. All earlier ratings (at least 10) comprise the train set. <br>\n",

    "Next, we start improving our bias model by letting item biases share components for items linked by the taxonomy. For example, tracks in a good album may all be rated somewhat higher than the average, or a popular artist may have all her songs rated a bit higher than the average. We therefore add shared bias parameters to different items with a common ancestor in the taxonomy hierarchy. We expand the item bias model **for tracks** as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} B_{i} = b_{i} + b_{album(i)} + b_{artist(i)} + \\frac{1}{|genres(i)|} \\sum_{g\\in genres(i)}^{}b_{g}\\end{equation}\n",

These effects are captured by user session biases.\n",
