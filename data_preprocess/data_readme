Yahoo! Music rating datasets
============================

The four packaged datasets exist under the subdirectories all/, large/, medium/, and small.ltr/.

The three directories all/, large/, and medium/ contain three versions of the music dataset, which differ by their size. 
For each directory, the dataset is stored in the following files:
- Training data: trainIdx_?_1A1.txt
- Validation data: probeIdx_?_1A1.txt
- Test data: testIdx_?_1A1.txt

These files list the ratings, grouped by user.
First line for a user is formatted as: <UsedId>|<#UserRatings>
Each of the next <#UserRatings> lines describes a single rating by <UsedId>, sorted in chronological order.
Rating line format is: <ItemId>\t<Score>\t<Time>
The scores are integers lying between 0 and 100.

All user id's and item id's are consecutive integers (no holes!), both starting at zero.
An item has at least 20 ratings in the total dataset (including train, validation, and test sets).
Each user has at least 10 ratings in the training data, which were performed earlier than the validation ratings 
(for the same user).
Then, each user has exactly 4 ratings in the validation data, which come earlier in time than the ratings by the same
user in the test data.
Finally, the test data holds the last 6 ratings of each user.

An additional fourth, smaller dataset is stored under small.ltr/. This dataset is structured somewhat differently than
the other three, and is intended for a different kind of learning task. The dataset is stored in the two files:
- Training data: trainIdx_3_1A1.txt
- Test data: testIdx_3_1A1.txt

The small.ltr/ files are formatted similarly to the aforementioned sets. One difference is that the <Time> field is omitted.
In addition, there is no validation set, and the test set includes only track ratings.
The more important difference is that 3 out of the 6 items listed for a user in the test set, have never been rated by 
the user, and hence their associated rating value is a negative "-1". The rest 3 ratings a user has in the test set are
"high" ratings, that is, scored 80 or higher. Choice of ratings into the test set does not consider their time.
Note that many users do not participate in this test set at all. 
The goal of such a test set would be differentiating high ratings from missing ones, which requires extending the 
generalization power of the learning algorithm also to the missing entries as required in real life scenarios.


For all datasets we relabeled both items and users by a crypto-strong permutation.

Note that item id's can represent tracks, albums, artists or genres. 
The type of each item, including an hierarchical structure linking tracks, albums, artists and genres, is stored
(separately for each the four datasets) in the following 4 files:

- trackData.txt.gz -- Track information formatted as: <TrackId>|<AlbumId>|<ArtistId>|<Optional GenreId_1>|...|<Optional GenreId_k>\n
- albumData.txt.gz -- Album information formatted as: <AlbumId>|<ArtistId>|<Optional GenreId_1>|...|<Optional GenreId_k>\n
- artistData.txt.gz -- Artist listing formatted as: <ArtistId>\n
- genreData.txt.gz -- Genre listing formatted as: <GenreId>\n

A second, alternative version of each file adds more confidential information fields, starting at the second field:
<OriginalItemId>|<Item title>
For tracks and albums, we also add the field <Release Date>
These files, which expose the items' identity, need not be part of the Webscope external distribution, but were created for internal usage and monitoring.

Finally, general statistics of the dataset, which are described in stats.txt, are as follows:
